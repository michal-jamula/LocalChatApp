## Simple Chat App

### How to run:
 - Start SimpleChatServer
 - Start SimpleChatClient (or multiple instances)

The server will run on localhost:5000 and receive data from the clients.
The server will also send out that data to all the other clients who are connected.


This is a simple app from the book Head Fist Java, (3rd edition) by Katy Sierra, Bert Bates and Trisha Gee.
I used this project to practise basic networks and multithreading
